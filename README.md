Hey! I'm just a girl coding things at UF! I'm in Computer Science, and will graduate by 2026.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on APIs for the API group at the Open Source Club
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and C++
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: This is an alt account! My main account is a public-facing one, so I can't quite use that for UF.
