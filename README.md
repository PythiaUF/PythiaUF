# Triya Verma

Hey! I'm just a girl coding things at UF! I'm in Computer Science, and will graduate by 2026.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on APIs for the API group at the Open Source Club
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and C++
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her - might as well mention I'm trans 🏳️‍⚧️
- ⚡ Fun fact: This is an alt account! My main account is a public-facing one, so I can't quite use that for UF.

PFP is of Mitsuru from Persona 3 Reload.
